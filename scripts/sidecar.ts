/**
 * Writes the provenance sidecar that Pi Pocket reads beside an installed drop-in: `<name>.gallery.json` in the drop-in
 * folder, which is what makes Menu → Extensions show the extension's title and the place it came from.
 *
 *     bun run scripts/sidecar.ts            # after install.ts, with the files that it deployed
 *
 * The sidecar holds the gallery entry that `scripts/gallery-entry.ts` writes, and the index it came from. It is not part
 * of this repository: it says where one installation came from, and its hashes describe the files on this machine.
